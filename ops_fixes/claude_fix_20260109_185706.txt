## ROOT CAUSE (2-4 sentences)

**These are TEST alerts, not production payment failures.** All log entries are prefixed with `TEST:` or `[TEST]`, indicating they were manually written to verify the alerting/watcher pipeline. The `__DEV_testSentryAlerts()` function in `lib/observability/sentryTags.ts` is correctly guarded with `if (!__DEV__)`, but it's exported from the public barrel (`lib/observability/index.ts`), which risks accidental import in production paths.

---

## EXACT PATCH PLAN

### 1. `lib/observability/index.ts` ΓÇö Remove dev-test function from public exports

```diff
 export {
   setPaymentScope,
   updatePaymentStage,
   clearPaymentScope,
   capturePaymentError,
   isUserCancellation,
   withPaymentTracking,
-  __DEV_testSentryAlerts,
+  // __DEV_testSentryAlerts intentionally NOT exported from barrel
+  // Import directly from './sentryTags' in dev screens if needed
 } from './sentryTags';
```

### 2. `ORBITAL_ALERTS.log` ΓÇö Clear test entries

```bash
# Clear the log to stop re-triggering the watcher
echo -n "" > ORBITAL_ALERTS.log
```

---

## VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **Confirm no production imports**: `grep -r "__DEV_testSentryAlerts" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | grep -v sentryTags.ts | grep -v index.ts` ΓÇö should return empty
2. **Build passes**: `npm run build` or `npx expo export` completes without errors (no missing export references)
3. **Watcher silent**: After clearing `ORBITAL_ALERTS.log`, confirm no new alerts trigger within 5 minutes

---

**Status: NO REAL PAYMENT FAILURE** ΓÇö This was test traffic verifying the observability pipeline. The fix hardens the export surface to prevent accidental use of the dev-only test function.
