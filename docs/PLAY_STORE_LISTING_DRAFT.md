## App Title

```
Orbital — Capacity Tracker
```

(30 character limit)

---

## Short Description

```
Log your daily capacity. See patterns over time. Private, offline-first, yours.
```

(80 character limit — this uses 77)

---

## Full Description

```
Orbital helps you track your personal capacity — how much energy, sensory bandwidth, and social load you carry each day.

LOG IN SECONDS
Record your capacity signals with a simple slider interface. No typing, no journaling — just quick daily check-ins that take under 30 seconds.

SEE YOUR PATTERNS
After a few days of logging, Orbital reveals patterns in your capacity over time. See which days tend to be higher or lower. Notice weekly rhythms. Understand your own data.

PRIVATE BY DEFAULT
Your data stays on your device. When you sign in, it syncs across your devices — encrypted in transit, secured with row-level access control. Nobody else can see your logs. Not even us.

SHARE ON YOUR TERMS
Circles let you share capacity patterns with people you trust — family, close friends, trusted supporters. Every member must explicitly consent. No surprises, no surveillance.

CAPACITY CREDENTIAL INDEX (CCI)
When you're ready, generate a formal capacity summary — a PDF document synthesizing your patterns over time. Useful for personal records, workplace conversations, or professional consultations.

WHAT ORBITAL IS NOT
Orbital is not a diagnosis tool. It does not provide medical advice, clinical assessments, or treatment recommendations. It is a personal data instrument — you record, you own, you decide what to do with it.

BUILT FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK DIFFERENTLY
Orbital was designed from the ground up for neurodivergent individuals, people with chronic conditions, caregivers, and anyone whose capacity fluctuates in ways that standard tools don't capture.

PRICING
- Starter (Free): Unlimited logging, 7-day pattern history
- Pro ($29/month or $290/year): Full pattern history, trend analysis, data export
- Circle ($79/month or $790/year): Shared visibility for up to 5 people
- CCI: One-time purchase for capacity credential generation

OFFLINE-FIRST
Works without internet. Your data is stored locally first, always. Cloud sync happens automatically when you're connected.

OPEN DATA, ALWAYS
Export your data anytime as CSV or PDF. Your data belongs to you. If you leave, it comes with you.
