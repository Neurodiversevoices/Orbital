## THE ORB

The Orb is the central UI element. It is:
- A three-state indicator (resourced/stretched/depleted)
- Self-evident or nothing
- Not explained by tutorials
- The primary interaction surface

### Orb Behavior

- Tap to log a capacity signal
- Color reflects current state selection
- Pulse animation on save
- No labels, no instructions

---

## SILENT ONBOARDING

Per SILENT_ONBOARDING.md doctrine:

"If a user is confused, that is acceptable. If a user is instructed, the system has failed."

- No tutorial flows
- No coach marks
- No onboarding modals
- No feature tours
- No "getting started" guides

The Orb is self-evident.
