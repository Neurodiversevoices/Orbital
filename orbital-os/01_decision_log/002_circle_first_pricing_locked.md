# Decision 002: Circle-First Pricing Locked
## Date: January 2026
## Status: LOCKED

---

## Decision

Final pricing structure for Class A:

| Tier | Monthly | Annual |
|------|---------|--------|
| Individual | $29 | $290 |
| Circle (5 seats) | $79 | $790 |
| Circle Expansion | +$10/seat | +$100/seat |
| 10-Seat Bundle | $399 | $3,990 |
| 25-Seat Bundle | $899 | $8,990 |

QCR Artifacts:
| Scope | Price |
|-------|-------|
| Individual | $149 |
| Circle | $299 |
| Bundle | $499 |

---

## Rationale

1. **Annual = 10x Monthly**: Simple, memorable, easy to explain
2. **Circle is anchor**: Most users will be in Circles, not solo
3. **Bundles are Class A**: Program administrators, not employers
4. **QCR scope-matched**: Prevents misuse of artifact access

- No trial periods
- No discounts without logged decision
- Annual default-selected at checkout
- Downgrades blocked (upgrades allowed)

---
