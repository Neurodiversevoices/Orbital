# Decision 004: Citadel Pricing Stack Locked
## Date: January 2026
## Status: LOCKED — APPROVED

---

## Decision

The Citadel 4-Layer Class B pricing stack is APPROVED as the canonical commercial model for Institutional deployments.

This decision supersedes and replaces all prior Class B pricing drafts, including:
- Per-employee risk fee models
- Base license + retainer models
- Any SaaS-style per-seat pricing concepts

---

## Core Framing

**Class B is a Risk Transfer Protocol, not SaaS pricing.**

Orbital is not selling software access. Orbital is selling:
1. Sovereignty (legal and technical containment)
2. Coverage (the right to collect signals)
3. Governance (the right to operationalize data)
4. Assurance (board-level risk documentation)

Each layer addresses a distinct budget owner and procurement path.

---

## Budget Owner Mapping

| Layer | Name | Budget Owner | Rationale |
|-------|------|--------------|-----------|
| Layer 1 | Sovereignty License | IT / SecOps | Infrastructure, security, compliance |
| Layer 2 | Capacity Coverage | HR / Benefits / Insurance | Employee wellbeing, risk mitigation |
| Layer 3 | Governance & Intelligence Rights | Legal / Risk | Labor law compliance, aggregation controls |
| Layer 4 | Strategic Assurance | CEO / Board | Fiduciary documentation, board reporting |

---

## Pricing Stack

| Layer | Description | Price |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Sovereignty License | $250,000/year (flat) |
| 2 | Capacity Coverage | $1,000/employee/year |
| 3 | Governance & Intelligence Rights | $150,000/year (flat) |
| 4 | Strategic Assurance | $100,000/year (flat) |

---

## Sample Deal Math (1,000 Employees)

| Component | Calculation | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Layer 1: Sovereignty | Flat | $250,000 |
| Layer 2: Coverage | 1,000 × $1,000 | $1,000,000 |
| Layer 3: Governance | Flat | $150,000 |
| Layer 4: Assurance | Flat | $100,000 |
| **Total Contract Value** | | **$1,500,000** |

---

## Structural Constraints

1. **Collection does not imply Visibility.** Layer 2 permits signal ingestion. Layer 3 permits operationalization.
2. **No bundled pricing.** Each layer is priced and sold independently.
3. **No per-seat SaaS model.** This is risk transfer infrastructure, not software licensing.
4. **Governance is mandatory for visibility.** Raw signals without Layer 3 are intentionally non-actionable.

---

## Supersedes

- All prior Class B pricing discussions
- "Base license + per-employee + retainer" model
- Any concept of "enterprise bundles"
- Any SaaS-style subscription framing
