## 4. DECISION FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 Scope Creep Rejection Protocol

When a feature request arrives:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                FEATURE REQUEST                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │
                        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does it require daily user attention?               │
│ YES → REJECT                                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │ NO
                        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does it use prohibited language/concepts?           │
│ YES → REJECT                                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │ NO
                        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Does it increase cognitive load?                    │
│ YES → REJECT (unless it replaces existing)          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │ NO
                        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Would removal break longitudinal value?             │
│ NO → REJECT (nice-to-have, not core)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        │ YES
                        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Can it be implemented in < 1 week?                  │
│ NO → Queue for quarterly review                     │
│ YES → Add to weekly priorities (max 3)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Standard Rejection Responses

| Streaks/gamification | "Orbital does not use engagement mechanics." |
| Social features | "Orbital is a personal measurement tool, not a social platform." |
| Diagnostic features | "Orbital is non-diagnostic by design. We cannot add this." |

### 4.3 Escalation Criteria

Only escalate (seek outside input) when:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Legal/regulatory issue | Consult counsel |
| Security breach | Engage incident response |
| Acquisition interest | Consult advisor |
| Revenue drop > 20% | Review fundamentals |
| User data loss | Immediate response + disclosure |

- Negative reviews
- "Urgent" partnership opportunities

4. Solve it or defer it
5. Return to normal cadence
```

### 7.2 If Stuck on Decision

```
1. Apply the Scope Creep Rejection Protocol
2. If still unclear, choose the option that:
   - Requires less code
   - Adds less cognitive load
   - Is easier to reverse
3. If still unclear, defer to quarterly review
```

### 7.3 If Burned Out

```
1. Enable maintenance mode (no new development)
2. Verify all automation is functional
3. Take minimum 2 weeks away
4. Return with quarterly review
5. Consider: Is the cadence sustainable? Adjust.
```

### 7.4 If External Pressure (Investors, Partners, Users)

```
1. Thank them for the feedback
2. Do not commit to anything
3. Add to quarterly review queue
