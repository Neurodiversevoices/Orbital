  /**
   * CORE THESIS
   * -----------
   */
  coreThesis: {
    statement: `Longitudinal self-reported data is newly scarce, newly valuable,
and newly governable. Orbital exists to capture this opportunity
with appropriate restraint.`,

    elaboration: `Three structural changes have occurred simultaneously:

1. Institutions now need longitudinal human data they cannot collect directly.
2. Existing consumer health apps have destroyed trust through data exploitation.
3. Regulatory frameworks now make trustworthy data collection economically viable.

Orbital is designed for this moment—not the moment before it, when trust
destruction was profitable, and not the moment after it, when incumbents
will have adapted.`,
  },

  /**
   * THE THREE STRUCTURAL CHANGES
   * ----------------------------
   */
  structuralChanges: {
    change1: {
      name: 'Institutional Data Scarcity',

      observation: `Employers, payers, and health systems face a common problem:
they need to understand population-level human capacity patterns,
but they cannot ethically or legally collect this data directly.

- Employers cannot survey employees about "how they're doing" without
  creating legal exposure and trust destruction.
- Payers cannot observe member functional capacity outside clinical encounters.
- Health systems see patients episodically, missing longitudinal patterns.`,

      implication: `There is institutional demand for longitudinal capacity data
that is: (a) self-reported by individuals, (b) aggregated without
individual identification, and (c) governed by trustworthy third party.

This demand did not exist 10 years ago. It exists now.`,
    },

    change2: {
      name: 'Consumer Health Trust Destruction',

      observation: `The first generation of consumer health and wellness apps
optimized for engagement, data extraction, and advertising revenue.
Users learned that their health data was the product, not them.

Result: informed users now distrust any app that claims to help them
while simultaneously harvesting their data. This distrust is rational.`,

      implication: `The market has bifurcated. Low-trust users avoid health apps.
High-value users—those with longitudinal commitment potential—require
demonstrable data governance before engagement.

Most apps cannot serve this segment because their business model
depends on data exploitation. Orbital can serve it because Orbital's
business model does not.`,
    },

    change3: {
      name: 'Regulatory Viability',

      observation: `GDPR, CCPA, and emerging global privacy frameworks have
made transparent data governance economically viable.

Before: Data exploitation was low-cost. Governance was overhead.
Now: Data exploitation creates legal risk. Governance creates premium.

Companies with governance-first architecture can command premium pricing
from institutions that require compliance documentation.`,

      implication: `The regulatory environment now rewards exactly what Orbital
is built to do: capture valuable data with documented governance.
The compliance burden that constrains competitors is Orbital's moat.`,
    },
  },

  /**
   * WHY TIME IS THE ASSET
   * ---------------------
   */
  timeAsAsset: {
    principle: `Longitudinal data compounds in value. A single signal is meaningless.
A year of signals reveals patterns. Five years of signals reveals
trajectories that no cross-sectional survey can capture.`,

    competitive: `Any competitor who starts today cannot have the longitudinal
data that Orbital users will have accumulated. Time cannot be purchased.
Time cannot be accelerated. The earliest movers in longitudinal data
have structural advantages that grow with each passing quarter.`,

    institutional: `Institutions do not value "engagement metrics" or
"monthly active users." Institutions value:
- Data depth (how much history per user)
- Data governance (how trustworthy is the source)
- Data stability (will it still exist in 5 years)

Orbital optimizes for these institutional value criteria, not
consumer vanity metrics.`,
  },

  /**
   * WHY NOT EARLIER
   * ---------------
   */
  whyNotEarlier: {
    trust: `Before the trust destruction of the 2015-2022 consumer health app era,
users did not demand data governance. Now they do. Orbital's governance
posture is a feature only because trust was first destroyed.`,

    regulation: `Before GDPR (2018) and its global successors, compliance was
optional for consumer apps. Orbital's compliance-first architecture
would have been pure overhead. Now it's competitive advantage.`,

    institutional: `Before COVID-19, institutional interest in population
capacity monitoring was niche. Post-pandemic, every employer, payer,
and health system understands that workforce capacity is a business-critical
variable they cannot currently measure.`,
  },

  /**
   * WHY NOT LATER
   * -------------
   */
  whyNotLater: {
    incumbentAdaptation: `Large health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit,
existing EHR vendors) will eventually adapt to governance-first models.
When they do, their distribution advantage will matter. First-mover
longitudinal data advantage must be established before adaptation occurs.`,

    institutionalProcurement: `Enterprise software procurement cycles are
18-36 months. Institutions beginning vendor evaluation now will make
decisions by 2026-2027. Orbital must be positioned as a credible
option during current evaluation cycles.`,

    regulatoryWindow: `Current regulatory frameworks are favorable to
governance-first new entrants. Future frameworks may include
certification requirements that favor incumbents. Moving now
establishes track record before potential certification regimes.`,
  },

  /**
   * WHAT ORBITAL IS NOT DOING
   * -------------------------
   */
  notDoing: {
    notDisrupting: `Orbital is not disrupting healthcare. Disruption language
attracts regulatory scrutiny and institutional skepticism. Orbital
is providing a new category of longitudinal capacity data that
supplements—not replaces—existing clinical workflows.`,

    notHealing: `Orbital does not heal, treat, or improve users. It observes
and records. Users may find this observation useful. That is their
decision to make. Orbital makes no efficacy claims.`,

    notGamifying: `Orbital does not make data collection fun, engaging,
or addictive. It makes data collection calm, optional, and sustainable.
This is a feature for users who distrust engagement manipulation.`,

    notMonetizingData: `Orbital does not sell data. Ever. This constraint
eliminates the largest category of consumer health app revenue.
It also eliminates the largest category of consumer health app risk.`,
  },

Share with who you choose. Your data stays yours.`,

    longDescription: `Orbital captures one signal: your self-reported capacity
at a moment in time. High. Moderate. Low. That's it.

Over weeks and months, patterns emerge. Over years, trajectories become
visible that no single-day snapshot could reveal.

Orbital is not a wellness app. It does not nudge, notify, or nag.
It does not diagnose, prescribe, or recommend. It observes.

Your data is yours. Export anytime. Delete anytime. Never sold.

For individuals: Build a longitudinal record of your capacity.
For institutions: Aggregate population capacity insights with governance.

Non-diagnostic. Calm. Longitudinal.`,

    context: 'Opening statement for enterprise, payer, or health system conversations.',

    statement: `Orbital provides longitudinal capacity data that your organization
cannot ethically collect directly.

We capture self-reported capacity signals from individuals over time.
We aggregate this data without individual identification. We provide
governance documentation suitable for your compliance requirements.

We do not provide diagnoses, risk scores, or clinical recommendations.
We do not enable individual surveillance. We do not sell data.

The result: population-level capacity patterns that inform workforce
planning, program design, and resource allocation without the legal
and ethical exposure of direct collection.

We're not asking you to trust us. We're asking you to review our
governance documentation and decide if the structure meets your requirements.`,

  founderPositioning: {
    credibilityFirst: `I'm not here to sell you on Orbital. I'm here to explain
what we've built and let you decide if it's useful for your context.`,

    timeArgument: `The core insight is simple: longitudinal self-reported data
is structurally scarce and structurally valuable. Everyone who wants
this data cannot collect it directly. We can—if we do it with appropriate
governance. That's what we've built.`,

    notHype: `I'm not going to tell you we're changing healthcare or saving lives.
We're building a longitudinal observation tool. It's useful if you need
longitudinal observation. It's not useful if you don't. I'm not trying to
convince anyone they need something they don't need.`,

If it does, I'm happy to go deeper on governance, technical architecture,
or institutional deployment. Your call.`,
