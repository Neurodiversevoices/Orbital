## 1. THESIS

Orbital exists now because the window for establishing governed, longitudinal capacity measurement infrastructure is closing. Within 3-5 years, this category will be occupied by platforms with either (a) compromised data practices or (b) regulatory constraints that prevent the accumulation of meaningful longitudinal records.

The opportunity is time-bound. The asset is time itself.

---

## 2. MARKET CONDITIONS

### 2.1 Institutional Data Scarcity

Organizations increasingly need longitudinal human capacity data for:

| Domain | Use Case | Current State |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Employers | Workforce planning, accommodation design | No governed signal source |
| Healthcare | Baseline establishment, treatment monitoring | Episodic, clinical-only |
| Education | Student support, resource allocation | Absent or surveillance-based |
| Insurers | Population health, risk modeling | Derived from claims (reactive) |
| Pharma | Endpoint measurement, trial enrichment | Expensive, short-duration |

The gap: No source provides continuous, governed, non-diagnostic capacity data at scale.

### 2.2 Trust Destruction in Adjacent Categories

The "wellness" and "mental health" app categories have eroded user trust through:

| Practice | Consequence |
|----------|-------------|
| Data monetization | Users assume data is sold |
| Engagement optimization | Users feel manipulated |
| Diagnostic creep | Users fear being labeled |
| Employer surveillance | Users distrust institutional deployment |

Orbital enters with a trust-first position that cannot be retrofitted onto existing products.

### 2.3 Pre-Regulation Window

Regulatory frameworks for health-adjacent data are forming but not yet crystallized:

| Jurisdiction | Status | Implication |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| United States | Fragmented (HIPAA, state laws) | Early entrant can shape standards |
| European Union | GDPR + emerging AI Act | Governance-first approach aligns |
| United Kingdom | Post-Brexit framework forming | Opportunity for reference implementation |

Platforms established before regulatory hardening inherit operational flexibility that later entrants cannot access.

## 3. COMPETITIVE TIMING

### 3.1 Incumbent Limitations

Existing players cannot pivot to Orbital's position:

| Incumbent Type | Barrier to Pivot |
|----------------|------------------|
| Wellness apps | Business model requires engagement |
| EHR vendors | Clinical framing is structural |
| HR platforms | Employer-first creates trust gap |
| Consumer health | Symptom focus precludes capacity framing |

### 3.2 New Entrant Barriers

Future entrants face compounding disadvantages:

| Year | Orbital Advantage | Entrant Disadvantage |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Year 1 | First governed capacity record | No longitudinal data |
| Year 3 | 3-year baselines established | Cannot replicate time |
| Year 5 | Population-level patterns emerging | Regulatory environment harder |
| Year 10 | Infrastructure status achieved | Category defined by Orbital |

### 3.3 Temporal Moat

Time is the only asset that cannot be acquired, copied, or compressed. A competitor entering in Year 5 must wait until Year 10 to match Orbital's Year 5 longitudinal depth. This asymmetry compounds indefinitely.

## 4. TECHNICAL TIMING

### 4.1 Infrastructure Maturity

The technical stack required for Orbital is now commodity:

| Capability | 2015 State | 2025 State |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Mobile deployment | Native-only, fragmented | Cross-platform mature |
| Encryption at rest | Complex, expensive | Default, cheap |
| Offline-first sync | Difficult | Standard libraries |
| PDF generation | Server-dependent | Client-capable |
| Accessibility tooling | Afterthought | First-class |

Building Orbital in 2015 would have required 10x the resources. Building in 2025 is efficient.

### 4.2 Distribution Maturity

Enterprise software distribution is now streamlined:

| Channel | Friction Level |
|---------|---------------|
| MDM deployment | Low (standard protocols) |
| SSO integration | Low (OAuth/SAML standard) |
| Benefits platform integration | Medium (APIs available) |
| HIPAA-compliant hosting | Low (multiple vendors) |

---

## 5. CAPITAL EFFICIENCY

### 5.1 Build Cost vs. Value Asymmetry

| Component | Build Cost | Longitudinal Value |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Signal capture | Low | Infinite (time-bound) |
| Storage | Low | Compounds with duration |
| Governance infrastructure | Medium | Trust differential |
| Artifact generation | Low | Executive visibility |

The expensive asset (time) accrues passively. The cheap assets (code) enable accrual.

### 5.2 Revenue Timing

Orbital's revenue model aligns with longitudinal value:

| Phase | Revenue Source | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Year 0-2 | Individual subscriptions | Build governed user base |
| Year 2-4 | Institutional licenses | Demonstrate aggregate value |
| Year 4+ | Research partnerships | Longitudinal data unique |

Early revenue is modest. Long-term revenue scales with data duration.

## 6. STRATEGIC POSITION

### 6.1 Acquisition Attractiveness

Orbital becomes acquisition-attractive because:

| Factor | Value to Acquirer |
|--------|-------------------|
| Governed data asset | Cannot be built internally |
| Trust position | Cannot be retrofitted |
| Longitudinal depth | Cannot be accelerated |
| Institutional relationships | Pre-negotiated access |
| Regulatory alignment | Reduces integration risk |

### 6.2 Acquirer Profiles

| Acquirer Type | Strategic Fit |
|---------------|---------------|
| Healthcare platform | Population health baseline |
| HR technology | Workforce capacity signal |
| Insurance | Risk modeling input |
| Pharmaceutical | Trial enrichment, endpoint |
| Large tech | Enterprise health portfolio |

### 6.3 Defensive Position

Even without acquisition, Orbital's position is defensible:

| Threat | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Funded competitor | Cannot buy time |
| Platform integration | Governed data not shareable |
| Feature parity | Longitudinal depth matters more |
| Price competition | Value accrues over time |

---

## 7. FOUNDER TIMING

### 7.1 Personal Constraints

Orbital is built for:
- Minimal daily operational overhead
- Automated value accrual (signals compound without intervention)
- Patience-aligned incentives (value increases with time, not activity)

### 7.2 Long-Horizon Commitment

The founder commits to:
- 10-year operational horizon (minimum)
- Resistance to premature exit
- Governance-first decision making
- Anti-engagement philosophy

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

Orbital exists now because:

1. **The market needs governed capacity data** and no one is building it correctly
2. **Trust is destroyed** in adjacent categories and cannot be rebuilt
3. **Regulation is forming** and early entrants shape standards
4. **Time cannot be replicated** by later entrants
5. **Technology is mature** enough to build efficiently
6. **The founder is committed** to the long horizon required

The window is open. It will not remain open indefinitely.
