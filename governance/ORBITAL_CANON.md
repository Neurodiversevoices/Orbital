# ORBITAL CANON

**Classification:** INTERNAL - FROZEN
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Effective Date:** 2025-01-01
**Amendment Authority:** Board Resolution Required

## 1. INTERNAL CAPACITY DOCTRINE

### 1.1 Definition

**Capacity** is defined as the self-reported, momentary assessment of an individual's available functional resources at a given point in time.

Capacity is:
- **Non-clinical:** It does not measure, diagnose, or imply any medical condition
- **Non-psychological:** It does not assess mental states, emotions, or psychological constructs
- **Non-diagnostic:** It cannot be used to identify, screen for, or suggest any disorder
- **Self-reported:** The individual is the sole authority on their own capacity
- **Momentary:** Each signal represents a point-in-time observation, not a state

### 1.2 Governance Anchor

This definition serves as the immutable anchor for all product decisions, feature development, marketing language, partnership agreements, and institutional deployments. Any proposed change to this definition requires:

1. Board resolution with legal opinion
2. User notification (30-day advance)
3. Regulatory counsel review
4. Amendment to this document with version increment

### 1.3 What Capacity Is Not

Capacity signals SHALL NOT be interpreted as:
- Mood indicators
- Stress levels
- Mental health status
- Wellness scores
- Productivity metrics
- Performance indicators
- Symptom reports
- Risk assessments

---

## 2. ORBITAL REFERENCE DECLARATION

**Internal Use Only**

Orbital defines the longitudinal baseline for human functional capacity signals over time. The platform operates exclusively as a measurement layer. No interpretation is applied at the point of capture or storage.

### 2.1 Measurement Layer Principles

1. **Capture without interpretation:** Signals are recorded exactly as provided
2. **Storage without inference:** No derived meanings are computed from individual signals
3. **Aggregation without diagnosis:** Patterns emerge from data, not from clinical models
4. **Export without recommendation:** Artifacts describe; they do not prescribe

### 2.2 Interpretation Boundaries

Interpretation, if any occurs, happens:
- Only at the explicit request of the user
- Only through governed, read-only sharing with designated recipients
- Only in aggregate, longitudinal contexts (never single-signal)
- Never by Orbital itself

---

## 3. UNIT OF VALUE DEFINITION

The unit of value in Orbital is the **Continuous Longitudinal Capacity Record** (CLCR).

### 3.1 Characteristics

| Property | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| Governed | Subject to explicit user consent and data trust policies |
| Opt-in | Created only through voluntary user action |
| Interpretation-free | No meaning assigned at capture |
| Append-only | Signals are added, never modified |
| Time-stamped | Each signal carries immutable temporal metadata |
| Portable | Exportable in standard formats at user request |

### 3.2 Value Accrual

The CLCR increases in value through:
- **Continuity:** Unbroken temporal coverage
- **Duration:** Length of the longitudinal record
- **Consistency:** Regular signal contribution
- **Integrity:** Cryptographic verification of record authenticity

---

## 4. TIME OWNERSHIP PRINCIPLE

### 4.1 Temporal Value Tiers

| Duration | Classification | Value Proposition |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0-12 months | **Useful** | Personal pattern recognition begins |
| 1-5 years | **Strategic** | Longitudinal baselines become meaningful |
| 5-10 years | **Infrastructural** | Population-level reference data emerges |
| 10+ years | **Generational** | Multi-decade capacity patterns become research-grade |

### 4.2 Competitive Moat

Time cannot be compressed or replicated. A competitor entering the market in Year 5 cannot acquire Year 1-4 data. This temporal exclusivity is Orbital's primary competitive advantage.

### 4.3 Patience as Strategy

Orbital optimizes for:
- Long-term data integrity over short-term engagement
- Compound value over immediate monetization
- Infrastructure status over feature parity

---

## 5. FOUNDER RESTRAINT DOCTRINE

### 5.1 What Orbital Will Never Become

Orbital SHALL NOT become:

1. **A wellness application** - No lifestyle recommendations, habit coaching, or self-improvement features
2. **A productivity tool** - No task management, time tracking, or efficiency optimization
3. **A mental health platform** - No therapy, counseling, crisis intervention, or clinical workflows
4. **A symptom tracker** - No medical symptom logging, medication reminders, or health monitoring
5. **A social network** - No feeds, likes, shares, comparisons, or community features
6. **A gamified experience** - No points, badges, leaderboards, or achievement systems

### 5.2 Anti-Scope-Creep Protocol

Before any feature is approved, it must pass the following gates:

| Gate | Question | Required Answer |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| G1 | Does this require daily user attention? | No |
| G2 | Does this create engagement pressure? | No |
| G3 | Does this interpret individual signals? | No |
| G4 | Does this use prohibited language? | No |
| G5 | Does this add cognitive load? | No |
| G6 | Would removal break longitudinal value? | Yes |

### 5.3 Boredom Policy

"Boring" is not a feature request. User requests for:
- Dashboards
- Daily insights
- Notifications
- Streaks
- Reminders

SHALL be declined with the response: "Orbital is designed to require minimal attention. This is intentional."

| Prohibited | Replacement |
|------------|-------------|
| wellness | capacity |
| productivity | (omit) |
| mental health | (omit) |
| symptoms | signals |
| check-in | signal / log |
| burnout | depletion / low capacity |
| tracking | measurement |
| tracking | signal capture |
| score | (omit) |
| streak | (omit) |
| reminder | (omit) |
| notification | (omit - except system alerts) |
| discount | early-access terms |

| stress | demand load |
| anxiety | (omit) |
| depression | (omit) |
| diagnosis | (omit) |

### 6.2 Required Terms

| Context | Required Term |
|---------|---------------|

### 6.3 Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Code-level:** Lint rules reject prohibited terms in UI strings
2. **CI/CD:** Build fails if prohibited terms detected in user-facing copy
3. **Export templates:** Pre-approved templates only; no freeform text
4. **Legal review:** All external documents require language audit
5. **Training:** All personnel complete Language Enforcement certification
