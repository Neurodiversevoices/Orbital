# REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Status**: FROZEN
**Effective**: Permanent
**Classification**: Infrastructure Law

---

## I. PURPOSE

Design a single deep reference implementation that normalizes Orbital as a standard — not through sales, but through language and artifacts that become the default frame for capacity intelligence.

---

## II. CONSTRAINTS

| Constraint | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| One cohort | Single, well-defined population |
| One context | Single, bounded environment |
| One failure mode | Single, measurable outcome |
| 6–12 month horizon | Time-bound with clear endpoints |
| Output is language and artifacts | Not case studies, not testimonials |

---

## III. SELECTED REFERENCE: K-12 SPECIAL EDUCATION STAFF

### Why This Cohort

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **High volatility baseline** | SpEd staff experience documented capacity strain |
| **Measurable failure mode** | Unplanned absence, burnout leave, mid-year resignation |
| **Institutional motivation** | Districts face chronic staffing shortages |
| **Regulatory alignment** | FERPA-compatible, non-medical framing |
| **Language gap** | No existing standard for "staff capacity" |
| **Replication potential** | 13,000+ US school districts |

### Cohort Definition

```
Population: Special education teachers, paraprofessionals,
            and related service providers
Setting:    Single school district (5-15 schools)
Size:       50-150 participants
Duration:   One academic year (September-June)
```

---

## IV. THE SINGLE FAILURE MODE

### Definition: Unplanned Capacity Departure (UCD)

An **Unplanned Capacity Departure** is:

> Any instance where a staff member becomes unavailable for their expected role without ≥2 weeks advance notice.

**Includes**:
- Unplanned sick days (>2 consecutive)
- FMLA/disability leave initiation
- Mid-year resignation
- Involuntary termination for performance
- Extended stress leave
- Hospitalization

**Excludes**:
- Planned vacation
- Scheduled medical leave
- Maternity/paternity leave (planned >2 weeks ahead)
- Position changes (promotion, transfer)
- End-of-year departure

### Why This Failure Mode

1. **Objectively measurable**: HR records, not self-report
2. **Institutionally costly**: Districts calculate substitute costs
3. **Student impact**: Direct educational continuity harm
4. **Predictable window**: Volatility precedes departure
5. **Intervention-amenable**: Support can reduce risk

## VI. ARTIFACTS PRODUCED

These are the outputs that create standardization:

### Artifact 1: The Capacity Volatility Report (CVR)

A quarterly aggregate report showing:

```

**Why this creates standardization**: Districts will request "our CVR" — the format becomes expected.

### Artifact 2: The Staff Capacity Language Guide

A terminology document defining:

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| Capacity | Available functional resource for role demands | "Staff capacity varies by day and context" |
| Volatility | Variation in capacity over time | "High volatility precedes departure risk" |
| Signal | Single capacity self-report | "Staff logged 4 signals this week" |
| Resourced | High available capacity | "67% of staff are resourced today" |
| Stretched | Moderate available capacity | "Stretched staff need load adjustment" |
| Depleted | Low available capacity | "Depleted state requires recovery support" |

**Why this creates standardization**: The language enters district vocabulary and spreads.

### Artifact 3: The UCD Prediction Framework

A decision support document:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│        UCD RISK STRATIFICATION FRAMEWORK                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  ──────────────────────────────────────────                 │
│                                                             │
│  Low (0-15)       → 3% baseline                             │
│  Moderate (16-30) → 8% (2.7x baseline)                      │
│  Elevated (31-40) → 18% (6x baseline)                       │
│  High (41+)       → 34% (11x baseline)                      │
│                                                             │
│  INTERPRETATION                                             │
│  ──────────────                                             │
│  These are AGGREGATE probabilities, not individual          │
│  predictions. A staff member in the "High" volatility       │
│  group has elevated risk, but most will not experience      │
│  UCD. This framework supports resource allocation,          │
│  not individual intervention decisions.                     │
│                                                             │
│  NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS.                   │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this creates standardization**: Districts use the framework for planning; it becomes the reference.

### Artifact 4: The Replication Toolkit

A package enabling other districts to implement:

1. **Implementation checklist** (30 items)
2. **Staff communication templates** (5 documents)
3. **Data collection protocols** (technical spec)
4. **Analysis methodology** (statistical approach)
5. **Report templates** (CVR format)
6. **FAQ document** (50 questions)

**Why this creates standardization**: Easy replication accelerates norm formation.

---

## VII. HOW THIS CREATES STANDARDIZATION WITHOUT SELLING

### The Mechanism

```
Reference Implementation
        ↓
Artifacts (Reports, Language, Frameworks)
        ↓
Artifacts enter district vocabulary
        ↓
Other districts hear "CVR" and "volatility"
        ↓
"What's a CVR?" → Discovery
        ↓
"We need one too" → Demand
        ↓
Demand creates norm
        ↓
Norm creates standard
```

### What We Do NOT Do

| Activity | Why Not |
|----------|---------|
| Press releases | Creates sales pressure |
| Case study marketing | Positions as vendor, not standard |
| ROI claims | Creates transactional frame |
| Testimonial collection | Positions as product, not infrastructure |
| Competitive positioning | Standards don't have competitors |

### What We DO Do

| Activity | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Publish methodology | Standards are open |
| Share artifacts freely | Adoption over revenue (initially) |
| Support replication | Network effects matter |
| Present at EdTech/AASA | Norm-setting venues |
| Submit to peer review | Credibility through validation |

---

## VIII. SUCCESS METRICS

### Primary Metric

> **Language Adoption**: Number of districts using "capacity volatility" terminology in official documents within 24 months of reference completion.

**Target**: 50 districts (non-Orbital users) using terminology

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CVR requests from non-participants | 25 inbound inquiries |
| Replication toolkit downloads | 100 downloads |
| Citation in policy documents | 5 state/district policies |
| Academic citations | 10 citations |

### What We Do NOT Measure

- Revenue from reference district
- Conversion rate from reference
- "Leads generated"
- Marketing attribution

This is infrastructure formation, not sales pipeline.

---

## IX. RISK MITIGATION

### Risk: Correlation Not Found

**Mitigation**: Publish null result. Standards require honesty. A null finding still advances methodology.

### Risk: District Withdraws

**Mitigation**: Multi-site contingency. Prepare secondary district partnership.

### Risk: Staff Non-Adoption

**Mitigation**: Minimum viable cohort (50). Oversample to account for dropout.

### Risk: Data Quality Issues

**Mitigation**: Weekly quality checks. Engagement support for low-signal participants.

### Risk: Artifact Not Adopted

**Mitigation**: Co-develop with district. Their input ensures relevance.

---

## X. PERMANENCE

This reference implementation strategy is **frozen**. The single-cohort, single-context, single-failure-mode constraint is intentional.

Scope expansion would:
- Dilute focus
- Delay completion
- Reduce artifact quality
- Undermine standardization

One deep implementation creates more norm formation than ten shallow ones.
