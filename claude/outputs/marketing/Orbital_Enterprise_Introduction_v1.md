**Confidential – For Institutional Review**

## Executive Summary

Orbital is a capacity tracking platform that enables individuals to record and reflect on their available capacity over time. Through simple, voluntary daily signals, users build a longitudinal record of how their capacity fluctuates in response to environmental and situational demands.

### Why Capacity Visibility Matters Now

Modern work and learning environments place significant and often invisible demands on individuals. These demands—sensory, cognitive, and social—accumulate in ways that are difficult to observe until they manifest as disengagement, reduced performance, or unexpected escalation. Traditional approaches to understanding workforce or student wellbeing rely on lagging indicators: exit interviews, absenteeism data, or crisis events.

Orbital offers a different approach: early, self-reported capacity signals that surface patterns before they become problems.

### Who This Is For

Orbital is designed for:

- Employers and HR leaders seeking early visibility into workforce capacity trends
- Employee Resource Groups supporting neurodivergent employees or those managing chronic conditions
- School districts and special education administrators supporting student self-regulation
- Caregivers and families navigating IEP conversations or accommodation planning

### What Orbital Is Not

Orbital is not a diagnostic tool. It does not assess, score, or classify individuals. It does not replace clinical judgment, medical evaluation, or professional guidance. It is a self-reported capacity record—nothing more, nothing less.

## The Problem We See

### Invisible Overload in Modern Environments

The demands placed on individuals in contemporary workplaces and educational settings are substantial and often invisible. Sensory environments, cognitive load, social expectations, and scheduling pressures accumulate throughout the day. For many individuals—particularly those with neurodivergent profiles, chronic health conditions, or caregiving responsibilities—these demands consume capacity at a rate that is not externally observable.

By the time overload becomes visible, it has often already resulted in reduced engagement, missed work or school, strained relationships, or formal escalation.

### Why Existing Tools Fall Short

Most institutional tools for understanding individual capacity rely on retrospective data: annual surveys, performance reviews, attendance records, or incident reports. These instruments capture outcomes, not early signals. They tell institutions what happened, but not what was building.

Existing wellness platforms often focus on prescriptive interventions—steps taken, sleep logged, meditation minutes completed. These tools measure activity, not available capacity. They do not surface the gradual erosion that precedes significant events.

### Why Institutions Are Often Surprised

Leaders are frequently caught off guard by burnout, disengagement, or behavioral escalation precisely because the signals were never visible. The individual may have been managing successfully for weeks or months, absorbing increasing load without external indication—until capacity was exhausted.

Orbital is designed to make these invisible patterns visible, early, and in a manner that respects individual privacy and autonomy.

## Introducing Capacity Intelligence

### What Is Capacity Intelligence?

Capacity intelligence refers to the systematic collection and analysis of self-reported capacity signals over time. Unlike productivity metrics or wellness scores, capacity intelligence focuses on a single, fundamental question: how much available capacity does an individual have at a given moment?

This is not a performance measure. It is not a behavioral assessment. It is a longitudinal record of subjective capacity, reported by the individual, for the individual.

### Simple Daily Signals

Capacity intelligence begins with simple daily check-ins. Users record their current capacity state—high, stable, or depleted—along with optional context about the primary drivers of that state: sensory load, cognitive demand, or social factors.

Each signal takes seconds. There are no surveys, no questionnaires, no required explanations.

### Patterns Over Time

Individual signals become meaningful when viewed in aggregate. Over days and weeks, patterns emerge: which days are consistently difficult, which environments drain capacity most rapidly, which periods show recovery.

These patterns are visible only to the individual unless they choose to share them.

### Confidence Improves with Participation

Like any longitudinal dataset, the reliability of capacity intelligence improves with consistent participation. Orbital does not require daily logging, but patterns sharpen as data accumulates. Users who log regularly develop a clearer picture of their own capacity dynamics.

## How Orbital Works

### Individual Daily Check-Ins

At its core, Orbital is a personal capacity journal. Users open the application and record their current state using a simple visual interface. They may optionally note which category of demand—sensory, cognitive, or social—is most affecting their capacity.

No narrative is required. No justification is expected. The signal is recorded with a timestamp and stored locally on the user's device.

### Seven-Day Baseline for Patterns

After seven days of logging, users gain access to their pattern view. This view displays capacity over time, highlights trends, and surfaces correlations between capacity states and tagged drivers.

The seven-day threshold exists intentionally. Patterns require data. Orbital does not speculate based on insufficient information.

### Consistency Improves Insight Quality

Users who log consistently—even briefly—develop richer pattern data. Orbital tracks logging streaks and provides confidence indicators that reflect data density. A pattern based on 90 days of signals is more reliable than one based on 14.

This is communicated transparently. Users always know how much data underlies any insight.

### Users Always Control Their Data

All data remains on the user's device unless explicitly shared. Users may export their data at any time in standard formats. Users may delete their data permanently. Users decide if, when, and with whom their capacity record is shared.

Orbital does not monetize user data. Orbital does not sell access to individual records.

## Privacy, Governance, and Trust

### No Individual Surveillance

Orbital is not a monitoring tool. Employers and institutions cannot observe individual capacity logs. There is no dashboard that displays employee or student capacity in real time. Individual data is never transmitted to institutional systems without explicit, revocable user consent.

### No Behavioral Scoring

Orbital does not generate scores, risk ratings, or performance predictions. It does not classify individuals as high-risk, low-performing, or requiring intervention. The platform records what users report—nothing more.

### No Diagnosis

Orbital is explicitly non-diagnostic. It does not assess mental health, neurological status, or medical conditions. It does not suggest diagnoses, recommend treatments, or provide clinical guidance. Capacity is not a proxy for wellness, and Orbital does not conflate the two.

### Aggregate-Only Institutional Views

When institutions deploy Orbital, they receive access only to aggregate data. This data reflects group-level capacity trends across teams, departments, or cohorts—never individual records. Aggregate views require minimum participation thresholds to prevent inference of individual states.

### User-Controlled Sharing

Users may choose to share their capacity summary with designated recipients: a manager, a caregiver, a clinician, or an educator. Sharing is time-limited, revocable, and logged. Users see exactly what was shared, with whom, and when.

### Auditability and Transparency

Every share, export, and access event is recorded in the user's audit log. Institutions receive aggregate access logs for compliance purposes. There are no hidden data flows.

## Team and Organization View

### For Employers and Employee Resource Groups

Orbital's Team Mode provides organizational leaders with aggregate visibility into workforce capacity patterns. This view is designed for HR leaders, ERG coordinators, and managers seeking to understand group-level trends without accessing individual data.

### Aggregate Capacity Pulse

The Team Mode dashboard displays:

- **Capacity distribution**: the percentage of participants reporting high, stable, or depleted capacity during a given period
- **Primary drivers**: the most frequently cited sources of capacity load (sensory, demand, social)
- **Weekly trend**: whether aggregate capacity is improving, stable, or declining
- **Participation confidence**: an indicator of how much data underlies the aggregate view

### Minimum Group Thresholds

Aggregate data is only displayed when participation meets minimum thresholds. By default, this threshold is ten participants. If fewer than ten individuals have logged during a period, no aggregate is shown. This prevents inference of individual states in small teams.

### What Leaders Can See

- Group-level capacity distribution
- Trend direction over time
- Common capacity drivers across the group
- Suggested environmental adjustments based on aggregate patterns

### What Leaders Cannot See

- Individual capacity logs
- Individual participation status
- Which specific individuals are depleted
- Any identifying information tied to capacity states

## School Zone Context

### For Education and IEP Support

Orbital's School Zone mode is designed for educational settings where students, caregivers, and educators benefit from capacity visibility. It is particularly relevant for students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), 504 plans, or other accommodation frameworks.

### Student Self-Regulation Support

Students use Orbital to log their own capacity throughout the school day or week. This practice supports self-awareness and self-advocacy—core skills emphasized in modern special education frameworks.

Students see their own patterns. They learn which environments, times of day, or activities correlate with capacity depletion. This knowledge supports self-regulation without requiring external monitoring.

### Caregiver-Controlled Summaries

Caregivers—parents or guardians—may generate a School Summary Card based on their child's logged data. This card provides:

- Capacity trend over a selected period
- Common drivers of depletion
- Environmental factors that help or hinder capacity
- A summary suitable for sharing with educators or support teams

Caregivers control whether and when this summary is generated. Personal notes are excluded by default. The summary is designed to facilitate productive IEP conversations without exposing private reflections.

### Aggregate Educator Insights

Educators with students enrolled in School Zone may access aggregate class-level capacity data. This view follows the same privacy principles as Team Mode: minimum thresholds, no individual identification, aggregate patterns only.

Educators can observe whether the class as a whole is experiencing elevated demand, which drivers are most common, and whether trends are improving or declining. This information may inform instructional pacing, environmental adjustments, or scheduling decisions.

### Alignment with Inclusive Education

Orbital is designed to complement—not replace—existing special education frameworks. It provides data that students and caregivers control, shared on their terms, to support accommodation planning and progress monitoring.

### Clear Boundary from Medical or Behavioral Tools

Orbital does not assess behavior. It does not track incidents, outbursts, or compliance. It does not generate behavioral scores or risk ratings. It is a capacity record, reported by the individual, for the purpose of self-awareness and communication.

## Value to the Institution

### For Employers

**Early Visibility**
Aggregate capacity data provides early warning of workforce strain. Leaders can observe declining capacity trends before they manifest as turnover, absenteeism, or reduced performance.

**Better Conversations**
When employees choose to share their capacity patterns, managers gain context for more productive one-on-one conversations. These conversations shift from speculation to shared data.

**Reduced Surprise Outcomes**
Organizations that understand capacity trends are less likely to be surprised by sudden departures, leave requests, or accommodation needs. Early visibility enables proactive response.

### For Schools

**Improved Self-Advocacy**
Students who understand their own capacity patterns are better equipped to advocate for their needs. This supports the development of self-regulation skills emphasized in transition planning.

**Better Parent-School Alignment**
Caregiver-generated summaries provide a shared reference point for IEP meetings and accommodation discussions. Both parties work from the same data, reducing miscommunication.

**Lower Escalation Risk**
When capacity depletion is visible early, educators and support teams can intervene before escalation. Environmental adjustments, schedule modifications, or check-ins can be offered proactively.

## Implementation Philosophy

### Voluntary Participation

Orbital is designed for voluntary adoption. Employees and students choose whether to participate. There are no mandates, no required logging frequencies, and no penalties for non-participation.

Institutions benefit most when participation is genuine. Coerced data is unreliable data.

### Lightweight Deployment

Orbital requires no integration with existing enterprise systems. It operates as a standalone mobile application. Users download the app, optionally enter a team or school code, and begin logging.

There are no IT dependencies, no SSO requirements, and no data synchronization with HRIS or SIS platforms unless explicitly requested.

### No Disruption to Existing Systems

Orbital does not replace existing HR, wellness, or special education systems. It provides a supplementary data layer—capacity signals—that complements existing processes.

Organizations continue to use their established tools for performance management, accommodation tracking, and compliance. Orbital adds visibility without disruption.

### Designed for Pilots and Phased Rollout

Orbital is well-suited to pilot programs. A single team, department, or school can adopt Orbital independently. Results from pilots inform broader rollout decisions.

There are no minimum seat requirements and no long-term commitments required for initial exploration.

## Appropriate Use and Limitations

### What Orbital Is Not Designed to Do

Orbital is not designed to:

- Diagnose medical or psychological conditions
- Predict individual performance or behavior
- Replace clinical assessment or professional judgment
- Monitor employee or student activity
- Generate risk scores or intervention triggers
- Serve as evidence in employment or disciplinary proceedings

### Where Professional Judgment Remains Essential

Capacity data is self-reported and subjective. It reflects individual perception, not objective measurement. Professional judgment—from HR leaders, clinicians, educators, and support teams—remains essential for interpreting context, making decisions, and providing appropriate support.

Orbital provides data. It does not provide recommendations, diagnoses, or action plans.

### Why Restraint Is Intentional

Orbital is deliberately narrow in scope. It records capacity. It surfaces patterns. It facilitates sharing when users choose.

This restraint is intentional. Broad claims invite misuse. Narrow tools, clearly defined, are more likely to be used appropriately and to maintain trust over time.

## Next Steps

### Pilot Discussions

We welcome conversations with organizations interested in exploring Orbital through a structured pilot program. Pilots can be scoped to a single team, department, ERG, or school and can be evaluated on terms appropriate to your institutional context.

### Institutional Review

We are prepared to support institutional review processes, including privacy assessments, security questionnaires, and governance discussions. Orbital is designed to meet the expectations of compliance-conscious organizations.

### Questions and Governance Conversations

We recognize that capacity data raises important questions about privacy, consent, and appropriate use. We welcome these conversations and are prepared to engage with legal, HR, compliance, and educational leadership to address concerns thoroughly.

Orbital exists to make invisible capacity patterns visible—on terms controlled by the individual, with institutional access limited to aggregate insights.

We believe this approach serves both individual autonomy and institutional responsibility.

We look forward to exploring how Orbital might support your organization.
